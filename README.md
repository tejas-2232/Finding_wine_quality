# Finding_wine_quality

* > In this exercise, we'll refactor code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
* > Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.
